                These General Standard Terms and Conditions are an essential and integral part of every offer and
                every agreement made with us (VILLA WESCO S.L.U., represented by the managing director Egbert
                Neuhaus, Bahnhofstraße. 205, 59759 Arnsberg, Germany; hereinafter also referred to as “Seller”).
                Specific terms and conditions which apply only in business to business transactions are identified as
                such. Any general standard terms and conditions of purchase of buyer that contradict these General
                Standard Terms and Conditions are not binding upon us unless they have been accepted by us in
                advance in writing. Verbal collateral agreements, additions or amendments to these General
                Standard Terms and Conditions are not valid unless confirmed by us in writing. Our offers are
                without obligation.
            </p>
            <br />
            In business to business transactions, our Terms and Conditions of Sale apply including in those cases
            where we make an unconditional delivery to buyer in the knowledge of the existence of buyer’s
            conflicting terms or terms that differ from our own Terms and Conditions of Sale. All understandings
            entered into between us and buyer for the purpose of executing this contract must be laid down in
            writing in this contract.
            Our Terms and Conditions of Sale apply to entrepreneurs, legal entities under public law or special
            funds under public law within the meaning of section 310(1) of the German Civil Code (BGB) and shall
            also govern all and any future transactions with the buyer as far as they are legal transactions of a
            related nature.<hr/>
